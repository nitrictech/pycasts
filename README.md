## Pycasts

Pycasts is a reference API for producing long form spoken audio and scripts for podcasts, powered by [Nitric](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric), [Suno Bark](https://huggingface.co/suno/bark) and [Llama 3.2](https://www.llama.com/).

Here's a sample of what can be produced with this project:

[power-rangers.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcb03055-c5d6-4883-8d0f-45fdf45191ca)

If you'd like a step-through guide on producing this API see [here](https://nitric.io/docs/guides/python/ai-podcast-part-1)

## Running locally

First off install project dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

This project uses also uses smaller LLMs for producing podcast scripts, which is baked directly into the resulting container when we deploy, via the `models` directory of the project.

This can be populated by downloading an appropriately sized and quantized Llama 3.2 model. As an example:

```bash
mkdir models
curl -L https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_L.gguf -o models/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_L.gguf
```

The project can be then run locally by installing the [Nitric CLI](https://nitric.io/docs/get-started/installation). And running
```bash
nitric start
```

This will start the project on your local machine, and you will be able to use the provided local [nitric dashboard](https://localhost:49152), or your HTTP client of choice to interact with the API.

Audio models are downloaded ahead of time using the API to be stored locally in a bucket, this can be done by hitting the `/download-model` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4001/download-model
```
> Assuming your API is hosted on 4001 (check your CLI output for `nitric start`).

Once the model has been fetched you're good to run the start generating podcasts.

For example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4001/podcast/peanut \
     -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
     -d "A podcast about the history of the peanut"
```

Would produce a short podcast style script and audio on the history of the peanut ðŸ¥œ.

Watch the logs in your CLI to see progress for now. Your output audio will be available in the `clips` bucket once everything has generated. See the local nitric dashboard [storage](http://localhost:49152/storage), to download your finished podcast.

## Deploying this project

A reference for deploying to AWS is provided along with the project under `nitric.aws.yaml`. 

For info on pre-requisites and setup see the [Nitric AWS provider docs](https://nitric.io/docs/providers/pulumi/aws).

You can also consult this [guide](https://nitric.io/docs/guides/python/ai-podcast-part-1) for instructions specific to this project.

Nitric supports GCP for this app, and may be included as a reference for this project in future as well.

## Possible project extensions

- [ ] Remove API endpoints and make podcasts on a schedule
- [ ] Use different voice models
- [ ] Add support for multiple speakers
